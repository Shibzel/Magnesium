# Magnesium Theme

This theme introduces a refined, dark mode aesthetic that is both stylish and functional for Visual Studio Code, Obsidian, and similar applications, seamlessly integrating subtle quality-of-life enhancements without altering the core experience.

## Installation

### For Firefox
Install from the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/magnesium).

### For VSCode and Obsidian
The development of Magnesium for Visual Studio Code and Obsidian is actively underway. While the theme is not yet available for these platforms, our roadmap includes launching for VSCode shortly, with plans for Obsidian to follow.

### For Other Applications
Magnesium is currently tailored for applications that are integral to my daily workflow. However, I am open to extending this theme to other software based on user interest and community support. If you wish to see Magnesium adapted for another application you use regularly, please feel free to suggest it in the issues section or contribute directly via a pull request.
